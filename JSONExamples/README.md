# Example JSON files for Open Badges specification 1.1

In the latest Open Badges specification there are three JSON files required:

1. Issuer Organisation
2. Badge Class
3. Badge Assertion

The Badge Class and Badge Assertion are created using this tool, the Issuer Organisation file can be found in the web folder.

Hopefully these example files will help you to understand how the three files reference each other to create a valid badge.
